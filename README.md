# Cheating memory game with Playwright framework ðŸ˜‰

Since the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) can read browser DOM, it is easy to make a test that solves the memory game with a minimal number of moves in no time.

## Installing dependencies
How to install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

## Running the project
How to run the tests:
```
npx playwright test
```

How to run the tests with open browser:
```
npx playwright test --headed
```

Or you can run a pre-defined script with the command
```
npm run test
```

## Memory Matching Game

I used here the [Memory Matching Game in JavaScript](https://codepen.io/chris__sev/pen/abLKKmj) developed by [Chris Sev](https://codepen.io/chris__sev) and all credits go to him
